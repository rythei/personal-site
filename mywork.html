                          Entering my Senior year at ASU, I was hired as a research associate in ASU's Luminosity Lab. Luminosity
                          is comprised of a team of top graduate and undergraduate students from a variety of fields, with the goal
                          of developing new technologies, specifically in the area of education. Projects include the development of
                        autonomous drones for safety escort, the education-competition website <a href = "https://mindspark.io/">Mindspark.io</a>,
                      and scalable smart-mirror technology.</p>
                      <p>For Mindspark, I developed a peer-ranking algorithm that allows users who enter competitions to judge their peers
                        and be ranked on certain skills. My algorithm uses topological sorting technique and a generalization of the ELO ranking system called TrueSkill.
                        The repository for my code implementing this ranking scheme can be found <a href = "https://github.com/rythei/ranking_backend">here</a>.
                      </p><p>
                        Another project I have led at Luminosity is the development of an Income Share Agreement scheme for student funding. The idea is to use equity investment
                        in students' educations rather than debt investment (i.e. traditional student loans). A short paper I wrote describing the idea can be found <a id="downloadLink" href="./ISA-paper.pdf" target="_blank"

                        The proposed program is currently under consideration by the University Administration.

                        As a graduate student, I will continue my work with the Luminosity Lab, leading a team of machine learning specialists on various research projects.

                        During the summer of 2015, I recieved funding as a part of an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates
                        (called MCTP) to work on an applied mathematics research project with Dr. Sebastien Motsch and fellow undergraduate Alex Reamy at ASU. Our work
                        focused primarily on an extension of model originally derived by mathematicians Cucker and Smale to describe
                        the dynamics of flocking and swarming behaviors in nature. The model is defined formally as a system of
                        ordinary differential equations (though we ultimately expanded the model to its analogous PDE and kinetic form),
                        and is designed to have the following basic properties: agents that are close to each other tend to repel, agents that are
                        far from each other tend to attract, and agents tend to align their velocities to those of their neighbors.
                        The relative intensity of these forces is determined by a defined "influence function".
                      </p><p>
                        The main aim of our research was to determine a sufficient condition that would guarantee the system's
                        convergence to some form of "flocking" behavior. Indeed, we were able to prove that, given a particular property
                        of the influence function, the system would converge to a "flock". Below is a numerical illustration of such
                        a convergence, randomzing the initial velocities of agents, in MATLAB:
