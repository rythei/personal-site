                  is the notion of learning <i>sufficient</i> (relative to a given task) and <i>minimal</i> representations of the state space. I am currently working on a technique to implement this idea
                specifically in the model-based reinforcement learning setting. You can find a working version of a paper as well as code on my <a href="https://github.com/rythei/EmbeddedStateRL">Github</a>.  </p></thead></span>

                    (called MCTP) to work on an applied mathematics research project with Dr. Sebastien Motsch and fellow undergraduate Alex Reamy at ASU. Our work

                    an influence function (one of the model's parameters), the system would converge to a "flock".</p><p>

                      working on a then-experimental customer service program, I was hired to work remotely as a Senior Data Analyst while finishing my
                      final year of undergraduate studies. In this role, I was charged with interpreting the vast amounts of customer service data to understand how Amazon could
                      most effectively allocate customer service resources to handle all customer inqueries while allowing for flexibility to account for the naturally stochastic nature of
                      call valume. This ultimately led to a project I spearheaded to build a high-dimensional optimization tool used to hire, transfer, and schedule customer service agents.
                      The tool I built is now used throughout Amazon customer service and is supported by a team of full-time developers. </p>

                          Entering my Senior year at ASU, I was hired as a research associate in ASU's Luminosity Lab. Luminosity
                          is comprised of a team of top graduate and undergraduate students from a variety of fields, with the goal
                          of developing new technologies, specifically in the area of education. Projects include the development of
                        autonomous drones for safety escort, the education-competition website <a href = "https://mindspark.io/">Mindspark.io</a>,
                      and scalable smart-mirror technology.</p>
                      <p>For Mindspark, I developed a peer-ranking algorithm that allows users who enter competitions to judge their peers
                        and be ranked on certain skills. My algorithm uses topological sorting technique and a generalization of the ELO ranking system called TrueSkill.
                        The repository for my code implementing this ranking scheme can be found <a href = "https://github.com/rythei/ranking_backend">here</a>.
                      </p><p>
                        Another project I have led at Luminosity is the development of an Income Share Agreement scheme for student funding. The idea is to use equity investment
                        in students' educations rather than debt investment (i.e. traditional student loans). A short paper I wrote describing the idea can be found <a id="downloadLink" href="./ISA-paper.pdf" target="_blank"
                  type="application/octet-stream" download="ISA-paper.pdf">here</a>.

                        As a graduate student, I will continue my work with the Luminosity Lab, leading a team of machine learning specialists on various research projects.

                        far from each other tend to attract, and agents tend to align their velocities to those of their neighbors.
                        The relative intensity of these forces is determined by a defined "influence function".
