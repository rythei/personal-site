                        Mindspark.io is a competition websites where students can access real-world problems provided by companies.
                        The idea is that students at universities often graduate having little knowledge of what types of problems are encountered
                        in industry, and hence little experience solving such problems. Mindspark attempts to bridge this gap by offering a
                        space where students can compete in teams to solve problems inspired by those that they might encounter after graduation.
                      </p><p>
                        One of the main features that we wanted the site to have was the ability to rank individuals on particular skills (say, web development
                        or data visualization) based on their submissions, so that potential employers could use this information to help make hiring decisions
                        from the website. Ultimately we decided that the best means to implement this was through a peer ranking system: students would rank
                        other students submissions based on a pre-defined set of criteria. The remaining questions was how to do this without creating adverse
                        incentives for students to rate others intentionally poorly. My solution is as follows:
                        for each submission,

                        During the summer of 2015, I recieved funding as a part of an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates
                        (called MCTP) to work on an applied mathematics research project with Dr. Sebastien Motsch at ASU. Our work
                        focused primarily on an extension of model originally derived by mathematicians Cucker and Smale to describe
                        the dynamics of flocking and swarming behaviors in nature. The model is defined formally as a system of
                        ordinary differential equations (though we ultimately expanded the model to its analogous PDE and kinetic form),
                        and is designed to have the following basic properties: agents that are close to each other tend to repel, agents that are
                        far from each other tend to attract, and agents tend to align their velocities to those of their neighbors.
                        The relative intensity of these forces is determined by a defined "influence function".
                      </p><p>
                        The main aim of our research was to determine a sufficient condition that would guarantee the system's
                        convergence to some form of "flocking" behavior. Indeed, we were able to prove that, given a particular property
                        of the influence function, the system would converge to a "flock". Below is a numerical illustration of such
                        a convergence, randomzing the ititial velocities of agents, in MATLAB:
